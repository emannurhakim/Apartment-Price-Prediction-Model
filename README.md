# Apartment-Price-Prediction-Model

## *1. Background*

The city of Daegu in South Korea has experienced steady growth in population and urban development, which increases the demand for housing, especially apartments. As the demand goes up, apartment prices can vary widely depending on several factors. For property developers, investors, and potential buyers, it is important to be able to estimate the selling price of an apartment accurately.

Machine learning can be a useful tool to solve this problem by using historical data to build predictive models. As a student who is currently learning data science and machine learning, this project is a great opportunity to apply the knowledge I have learned to a real-world case. Through this project, I aim to build prediction models and find out which one works best for estimating apartment prices in Daegu.

## *2. Problem Statements*
This project will try to answer the following questions:

| **No.** | **Question**                                                                                                        |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | How can we use apartment data in Daegu to predict the selling price?                                                |
| 2       | Which machine learning model gives the most accurate results in predicting apartment prices?                        |
